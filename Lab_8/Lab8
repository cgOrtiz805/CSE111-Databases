-It seems that queries with a index had a faster execution time than without b/c indexes do not search the whole db table.

Update lineitem_index:Query finished in 1.556 second(s).

Update lineitem_noindex: Query finished in 0.832 second(s).

-Updating a table with a index took longer 

7)
Update supplier_index:Query finished in 0.026 second(s).

Update supplier_noindex:Query finished in 0.013 second(s).

-Updating a table with a index took longer 


From my observation I can conlude that Indexes are great for increasing the performance and speed of 
queries by reducing the amount of data it scans. However for other processes such as Inserting,
Updating, and possibly Creating the indexed tables took longer the execute.
